Basic Workflow:
In order to encrypt the file the sender should have a private open key of the person 
to whom the file is going to be sent. The open key is used by the sender to encrypt the data
and cannot be used to decrypt it. The receiver can decrypt the file using his private secret
key and a passphrase.
Algorithm:
1.  Install GnuPG
2.  Generate public key and private key
a.  Select the algorithm for keys to be generated(RSA/DSA)
b.  Set the keysize between 1024 to 4096.
c.  Set validity of the key in terms of days.
d.  Enter your name, email and comments.
e.  Enter a secure passphrase to generate the keys finally.
3.  Create a revocation certificate.
4.  Import public key of receiver
5.  Encrypt the data file with the option -r
6.  Decrypt the encrypted data file at the receiver with option -d

Is this correct? (y/N) y
You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"
Real name: Ben
Name must be at least 5 characters long
Real name: Benedict
Email address: benedict.jn@rajalakshmi.edu.in
Comment: Message
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Benedict (Message) <benedict.jn@rajalakshmi.edu.in>"
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
